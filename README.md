#  FPGA Real-Time Digital Clock with Alarm & Snooze (OLED Display)

## Project Overview
This project implements a **Real-Time Digital Clock with Alarm and Snooze functionality** using **Verilog HDL** on an FPGA platform.  
The system displays **HH:MM:SS** on an **OLED display**, supports **manual time setting**, and provides an **alarm with an exact 30-second snooze feature**.

The design follows **synchronous digital design principles**, ensures reliable button handling through **synchronization logic**, and maintains stable OLED output without display corruption. The project has been verified on real hardware.

## Problem Statement
FPGA-based real-time clock systems require precise timing generation, safe user interaction, and stable display control. Challenges include:

- Generating an accurate 1-second clock from a high-frequency system clock  
- Preventing metastability from mechanical push buttons  
- Safely modifying time without disrupting clock operation  
- Implementing alarm and snooze functionality reliably  
- Maintaining stable OLED display output using SPI Protocol

This project solves these challenges using structured Verilog design, synchronized control signals, and OLED configuration.

- Displays real-time **HH:MM:SS** on OLED
- Stable OLED output 
- **Manual time setting** using hardware buttons  
- Freeze-and-set mechanism for safe time adjustment  
- Increment-by-one hour and minute control  
- **Alarm function** at preset time  
- **Snooze function** with exact 30-second delay  
- Button synchronizers to avoid metastability  
- Fully synthesizable and hardware-tested

## Clock Operating Modes

### Normal Mode
- Clock runs automatically  
- Time increments every second  
- Alarm monitoring active  

### Set Mode – Hours
- Clock is frozen  
- Hour value increments one step per button press  

### Set Mode – Minutes
- Clock remains frozen  
- Minute value increments one step per button press  

### Exit Set Mode
- Clock resumes normal operation with updated time

## Time-Set State Machine

| Set Button Press | Mode         | Description          |
|------------------|--------------|----------------------|
| 1st Press        | Set Hours    | Adjust hours         |
| 2nd Press        | Set Minutes  | Adjust minutes       |
| 3rd Press        | Normal Mode  | Resume clock         |

## Alarm & Snooze Operation

### Alarm Trigger
- Alarm activates when current time matches preset alarm time  
- LED and buzzer toggle at 1 Hz  

### Snooze Function
- Snooze button stops the alarm  
- Adds **exactly 30 seconds** to the current time  
- Snoozed alarm triggers once and then disables snooze  

### Alarm Reset
- Immediately stops alarm and snooze mode

## Verilog Implementation

### Design Files
- **top.v**  
  Implements clock generation, time counting, time-setting logic, alarm and snooze control, and OLED interfacing.

- **oledControl.v**  
  Handles OLED initialization, SPI communication, and display refresh.

## OLED Display Interface

**SPI PROTOCOL:**

 SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) is a fast, synchronous, full-duplex communication protocol used for short-distance data transfer between a master and slave devices. It uses four signals: SCLK, MOSI, MISO, and CS to control data and device selection. Due to its simplicity and high speed, SPI is widely used to connect FPGAs and microcontrollers with peripherals like OLED displays, sensors, and memory chips.

## Testing & Verification
- Manual button presses verified on hardware  
- Time increments correctly without jitter  
- Alarm and snooze trigger accurately  
- OLED display remains stable over long runtime
