## Problem Statement
FPGA-based real-time clock systems require precise timing generation, safe user interaction, and stable display control. Challenges include:

- Generating an accurate 1-second clock from a high-frequency system clock  
- Preventing metastability from mechanical push buttons  
- Safely modifying time without disrupting clock operation  
- Implementing alarm and snooze functionality reliably  
- Maintaining stable OLED display output using SPI Protocol

This project solves these challenges using structured Verilog design, synchronized control signals, and OLED configuration.

## Clock Operating Modes

### Normal Mode
- Clock runs automatically  
- Time increments every second  
- Alarm monitoring active  

### Set Mode – Hours
- Clock is frozen  
- Hour value increments one step per button press  

### Set Mode – Minutes
- Clock remains frozen  
- Minute value increments one step per button press  

### Exit Set Mode
- Clock resumes normal operation with updated time

## Time-Set State Machine

| Set Button Press | Mode         | Description          |
|------------------|--------------|----------------------|
| 1st Press        | Set Hours    | Adjust hours         |
| 2nd Press        | Set Minutes  | Adjust minutes       |
| 3rd Press        | Normal Mode  | Resume clock         |

## Alarm & Snooze Operation

### Alarm Trigger
- Alarm activates when current time matches preset alarm time  
- LED and buzzer toggle at 1 Hz  

### Snooze Function
- Snooze button stops the alarm  
- Adds **exactly 30 seconds** to the current time  
- Snoozed alarm triggers once and then disables snooze  

### Alarm Reset
- Immediately stops alarm and snooze mode

## Timing Table (Example)

| Time      | Event           | State   |
|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| 00:00:59 | Clock running   | Normal  |
| 00:01:00 | Alarm triggers  | Alarm   |
| 00:01:10 | Snooze pressed  | Snooze  |
| 00:01:40 | Snooze alarm    | Alarm   |
| Reset    | Alarm cleared   | Normal  |

## OLED Display Interface

**SPI PROTOCOL:**

 SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) is a fast, synchronous, full-duplex communication protocol used for short-distance data transfer between a master and slave devices. It uses four signals: SCLK, MOSI, MISO, and CS to control data and device selection. Due to its simplicity and high speed, SPI is widely used to connect FPGAs and microcontrollers with peripherals like OLED displays, sensors, and memory chips.

## Testing & Verification
- Manual button presses verified on hardware  
- Time increments correctly without jitter  
- Alarm and snooze trigger accurately  
- OLED display remains stable over long runtime
